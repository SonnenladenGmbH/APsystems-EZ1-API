# APsystems EZ1 -  Python Library

## Overview
The APsystems EZ1 Python library can be used to interact with APsystems EZ1 Microinverters. It provides a convenient way to communicate with the microinverter over your **local network**, allowing you to read and set various device parameters like power status, alarm information, device information, and power limits.

## Installation
- To use the APsystemsEZ1 library, you need to have Python 3.10 installed on your system. 
- You can easily install the `apsystems_ez1m` library via pip. The package is hosted on PyPI, making it straightforward to install and update. To install, run the following command:


```bash
pip install apsystems-ez1
```

## Usage
Here's a quick example of how to use the APsystemsEZ1 library:

```python
import APsystemsEZ1M

# Initialize the connection to the inverter
inverter = APsystemsEZ1M("192.168.1.100", 8050)

# Get device information
device_info = inverter.get_device_info()
print("Device Information:", device_info)

# Get alarm information
alarm_info = inverter.get_alarm_info()
print("Alarm Information:", alarm_info)

# Get output data
output_data = inverter.get_output_data()
print("Output Data:", output_data)

# Set maximum power limit
inverter.set_max_power(500)

# Get current power status
power_status = inverter.get_device_power_status()
print("Power Status:", power_status)
```

## Methods
The library includes several methods to interact with the microinverter:

- `get_device_info()`: Retrieves detailed information about the device.
- `get_alarm_info()`: Fetches the alarm status information for various components of the device.
- `get_output_data()`: Retrieves the output data from the device.
- `get_p1_output()`, `get_p2_output()`: Get the power output status of inverter inputs.
- `get_total_output()`: Calculates the combined power output status of inverter inputs.
- `get_p1_energy_today()`, `get_p2_energy_today()`, `get_total_energy_today()`: Retrieves the total energy generated today by inverter inputs.
- `get_p1_energy_lifetime()`, `get_p2_energy_lifetime()`, `get_total_energy_lifetime()`: Retrieves the total lifetime energy generated by inverter inputs.
- `get_max_power()`: Retrieves the set maximum power setting of the device.
- `set_max_power(power_limit)`: Sets the maximum power limit of the device.
- `get_device_power_status()`: Retrieves the current power status of the device.
- `set_device_power_status(power_status)`: Sets the power status of the device.

## Recommendations
- We highly recommend to set a **static IP** for the inverter you want to interact with. This can be achieved be accessing your local router, searching for the inverters IP and setting it to "static ip" or similar. A quick Google search will tell you how to do it exactly for your specific router model.
## Error Handling
The library includes basic error handling for HTTP and connection errors. Error messages are printed to the console.

## Contribute to this project
- Everyone is invited to commit changes to this library. This is considered a community project to realise countless projects that may need very specific new functionality. We're happy to see your ideas ;)
- You're also welcome to request new features to be built natively into the inverters API. We're in close contact with APsystems and happy to add new features in the future.
